# Contributing to Cinec Movie App

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Cinec Movie App as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Code Changes Via Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style conventions.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/cinec_movie_app/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/cinec_movie_app/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Process

We follow these coding standards:

### Dart/Flutter Style Guide

1. Follow the [official Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
2. Use `flutter format .` before committing
3. Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues
4. Keep lines under 80 characters
5. Use meaningful variable and function names

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Update tests for bug fixes
- Aim for high test coverage
- Run tests before submitting PR:
  ```bash
  flutter test
  ```

### Documentation

- Update README.md with details of changes to the interface
- Update API documentation for affected components
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Document known limitations or edge cases

## Community and Behavioral Expectations

- Be welcoming and inclusive
- Respect different viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members
